To some, this may seem as simple as a top list various entertainment, but to me, it's a list of art which has
moved me to my core. This kind of art has a power that transcends their respective genre boundaries, and often touches
a kernel of philosophical truth, without one necessarily being able to put a finger on "why" it does so.


I’ve always been interested in the “best” of pretty much every genre of art, rather than any given subject or genre itself.
One of the intrinsic reasons for this was made apparent to me in [Jordan Peterson's Maps of Meaning lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8Xc2_FtpHI&list=PL22J3VaeABQAT-0aSPq-OKOpQlHyR4k5h), where
he hypothesizes that stories are exactly the way humans have been able to learn abstract concepts from time immemorial.
Any really good story, teaches us something important about ourselves, or our environment which we can use to grow ourselves.

I want to stress that this list is highly subjective, as anything which touches someone deeply would be. I hope to keep
it updated if I ever stumble upon more such works, even though they are very far and few between. At some point,
I also hope to write a short summary of why I found a given piece important.
