A Norwegian with with a particular interest in distributed computing and machine learning.
Pretty much grew up on the internet, and with computers. Although my youth was mostly spent playing
games such as World of Warcraft, Counter-Strike and Unreal Tournament.

I love to learn things. These days that's mostly related to programming, but I try to keep an
open mind to learning other creative skills as well.

If you attached a tracking-device to me, you would frequently see me traveling to Japan.
I always try to be better today than I was yesterday, though I'm struggling more now than when 
my schedule was barren. 
I also really enjoy going to the gym to challenge myself, and keep the work-hazard of bodily decay
somewhat at bay.
