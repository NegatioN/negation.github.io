  Most men make the error of thinking that one day it will be done. They think, "If I can work enough then one day I could rest". Or, "One day my woman will understand something and then she will stop complaining". Or, "I'm only doing this now so that one day I can do what I really want with my life." The masculine error is to think that eventually things will be different in some way. They won't. It never ends. As long as life continues, the creative challenge is to tussle, play, and make love with the present moment while giving your unique gift.
