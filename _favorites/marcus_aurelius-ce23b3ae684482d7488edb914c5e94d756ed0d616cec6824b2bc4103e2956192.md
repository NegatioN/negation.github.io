  If a god were to tell you, 'Tomorrow, or at best the day after you will be dead', you would not, unless the most abject of greatly solicitous whether it was to be the later day, rather than the morrow - for what is the difference them? rather than between same way, do not reckon it of them? In the same way, do not reckon it of great moment whether it will come years and years hence, or tomorrow.
