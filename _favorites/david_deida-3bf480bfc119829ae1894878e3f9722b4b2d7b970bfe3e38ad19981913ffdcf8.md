  Success is never as fulfilling as you think it is going to be. But there is a reason for this. Successfully completing a lesser purpose doesn't feel very good for very long, because it is simply preparation for advancing toward a greater embodiment of your deeper purpose. Each purpose, each mission. is meant to be fully lived to the point where it becomes empty, boring and useless. Then it should be discarded. This is a sign of growth, but you may mistake it for a sign of failure.
